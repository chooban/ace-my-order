# My Ace Order

Yet another learning rewrite of the Ace Comics order helper.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##  Aim

This time around I'm using React, Typescript, and Gatsby.

##  Previous Iterations

### Parent

An app written to learn some React, Docker, and a microservice architecture. It's deliberately over-engineered
to use Node.js microservices deployed in a VPS running docker.

Even the React app was over-engineered with Redux middlewares, actor models, and strictly split components
for logic and presentation. It was fine while I was writing and learning, but looking back on it now
the layout of the project is confusing.

### Grandparent

This was [the original](https://github.com/chooban/acemyorder). No frameworks to begin with, just JS
and some PHP on the server side. It then morphed to a Docker setup so that I could learn that.
